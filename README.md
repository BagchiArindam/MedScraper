Small one time webscrape potential PoC code to deconstruct medicine composition in various Indian pharma websites and search medicines by composition more efficiently.

Problem Statement: 
All Indian pharma websites have inconsistent search functionalities, often admixing pseudoscientific products, sometimes search providing different results on phone and PC, 
sometimes mixing composition strength inside composition, non-idempotent filtering, incorrect information, false advertising among various other issues.


This is an attempt to makes sense of medicines being available online and verify their information against what is present on Indian government's list as reference, and finally provide correct results on query.
